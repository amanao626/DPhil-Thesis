# R scripts and data for doctoral thesis: A study on the intelligibility of Japanese accented English

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and related data used in my doctoral thesis submitted to the University of Oxford.
The thesis has mainly the following two purposes: 1) investigates factors that affect the intelligibility of Japanese accented English speech and 2. examines possibility of rapid adaptation to Japanese accented English after training. 
This repository makes available the resources used to show some resources difficult to present in thesis itself because of space and reproduce the statistical analyses and visualizations.

##Folder Structure
'data'
```Experiment 1 poilot study```
```Experiment 1 main experiment```

## How to Use

This repository contains R scripts and figures for each experiment conducted as part of my doctoral dissertation (e.g., Experiment 1 Pilot, Experiment 1 Main Experiment).  
Due to research ethics considerations, the original data are not publicly available. However, the structure and methods of analysis are documented in a reproducible format.

### Steps:
1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP file.
2. Open the `.Rproj` file or individual R scripts in each experiment folder in RStudio.
3. Each experiment folder (e.g., `Experiment 1 pilot/`) contains:
   - `scripts/`: R scripts for data processing, analysis, figure generation, and some real output
   - `figures/`: Figures and outputs included in the dissertation

> 💡 Although the data are not included, detailed comments in the scripts explain the required variables and preprocessing steps.
