#R Scripts and Data for Doctoral Dissertation: A Study on the Intelligibility of Japanese-Accented English

## Overview
This repository contains R scripts and related data used in my doctoral thesis submitted to the University of Oxford.
The thesis has mainly the following two purposes: 1) investigates factors that affect the intelligibility of Japanese accented English speech and 2. examines possibility of rapid adaptation to Japanese accented English after training. 
This repository makes available the resources used to show some resources difficult to present in thesis itself because of space and reproduce the statistical analyses and visualizations.
